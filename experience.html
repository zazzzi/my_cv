                <h2>Experience</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="mainText">
                <p> My early working life began with a lot of jobs in the restaurant business. I come from Italian
                    heritage and a
                    family that, when I was younger, ran a Italian bistro, so it felt natural for me to start my working
                    life in that way. <br><br> In my 20s, I realized that I wanted to do something else. I didn't really
                    know
                    what, so I did what every young
                    person does, try everything. I started studying 3D Animation at Högskolan Väst in Trollhättan but
                    soon came to the conclusion that the graphical part of
                    animation wasn't for me. Feeling a bit lost I took a job at a technical support center, at a company
                    called Webbhelp Nordic. We handled technical support
                    over the phone for a big American company, working mainly with laptops, tablets and phones. <br><br>
                    After being there for less then a year, I got offered a job as a
                    production assistant in Stockholm and moved to there. We created educational video material for
                    lawyers, with focus on digital evidence management. This was a really great experience, but after
                    about 7 months, when my part of the
                    project was done, it was hard to find a new job and living arrangements in Stockholm. So I was
                    forced
                    to move back to Gothenburg. <br><br>
                    The feeling of being in the same place as you were 2 years ago is always hard, so while picking up
                    smaller jobs in media production I wanted to try something new. I got a job in retail, working in
                    one of Whyreds storefronts in Gothenburg. Loving the social interaction that working in retail gave
                    me, whilst working with clothing and fashion, I really enjoyed working at Whyred. The hours weren't
                    great thought, so I applied to work at a store in Gothenburg called Vallgatan 12. A family owned
                    business
                    retailer that sells fashion and interior design. The time I spent there has been great and I still
                    work part time during my studies. <br><br> So when does the development part of my life start? Over
                    year ago I reconnected with an old friend, and in turn my old friend group. Most of them are
                    either fullstack developers or studying to become one. My friend, who's currently is studying
                    Systemutveckling (system development) soon after that moved in with me
                    and my interest for coding grew a lot. Found out about Medieinstitutet and their Front End Developer
                    program, applied and got accepted. I now feel like I finally found my calling in life and who knows
                    that the future has to offer. Hopefully it includes a lot of development, wether it be Front End or
                    Back End! </p>
